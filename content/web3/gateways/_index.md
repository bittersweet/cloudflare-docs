# Gateways

Cloudflare's Web3 Gateways serve as bridges between Web 2.0 and Web3, providing HTTP-accessible interfaces to the [IPFS](#interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) and [Ethereum](#ethereum) networks.

## Available gateways

### InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)

Cloudflare's IPFS gateway gives you read-only access to the [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](/web3/gateways/concepts/ipfs/) without downloading any special software or giving up any storage space on your computer.

### Ethereum

Cloudflare's Ethereum Gateway gives you read and write access to the [Ethereum network](/web3/gateways/concepts/ethereum/) without installing any software on your computer.

In particular, users can read all information that has been agreed upon by the consensus of
existing nodes in the network. In addition, they can write their own
transactions and smart contracts to be stored by these nodes in a distributed
manner. Anyone else on the network will be able to view these transactions, and
even run your smart contracts using their own supply of the Ethereum currency.

These interactions take place through the official [Ethereum JSONRPC API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis) and using [Cloudflare-supported API methods](/web3/gateways/reference/ethereum-gateway/supported-api-methods/).
